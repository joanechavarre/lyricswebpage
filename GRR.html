<h1>This I Promise You</h1>
<h2>NSYNC</h2>

<h3>Verse</h3>

<p><center>
Oh, oh<br>
When the visions around you<br>
Bring tears to your eyes<br>
And all that surrounds you<br>
Are secrets and lies<br>
I'll be your strength<br>
I'll give you hope<br>
Keeping your faith when it's gone<br>
The one you should call<br>
Was standing here all along<br>
</p></center>

<h3>Chorus<h/3>
<p><center>
And I will take you in my arms<br>
And hold you right where you belong<br>
'Til the day my life is through<br>
This I promise you<br>
This I promise you<br>
</p></center>

<h3>Refrain</h3>
<p><center>
I've loved you forever<br>
In lifetimes before<br>
And I promise you never<br>
Will you hurt anymore<br>
I give you my word<br>
I give you my heart (give you my heart)<br>
This is a battle we've won<br>
And with this vow<br>
Forever has now begun<br>
Just close your eyes (close your eyes) each loving day (each loving day)<br>
And know this feeling won't go away (no)<br>
'Til the day my life is through<br>
This I promise you<br>
This I promise you<br>
</p></center>

<h3>Verse2</h3>
<p><center>
Over and over I thought (over and over I thought)<br>
When I hear you call<br>
Without you in my life, baby<br>
I just wouldn't be living at all<br>
And I will take you in my arms (I will take you in my arms)<br>
And hold you right where you belong (right where you belong)<br>
'Til the day my life is through<br>
This I promise you, babe<br>
Just close your eyes each loving day (each loving day)<br>
And know this feeling won't go away (no)<br>
Every word I say is true<br>
This I promise you<br>
Every word I say is true<br>
This I promise you<br>
Ooh, I promise you<br>
